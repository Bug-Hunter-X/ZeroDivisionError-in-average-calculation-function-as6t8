This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError. The bug.py file contains a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers. This function does not handle the case where an empty list is passed in as an argument, resulting in a ZeroDivisionError. The bugSolution.py file provides a solution to this problem by adding a check for an empty list before calculating the average.
